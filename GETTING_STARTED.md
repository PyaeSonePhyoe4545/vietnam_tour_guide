# Vietnam Tour Guide Application - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 Project Overview

I've created a comprehensive Vietnam Tour Guide application with:

**Backend (NestJS)**:
- ✅ Complete API with destinations and accommodations endpoints
- ✅ MySQL database integration with TypeORM
- ✅ Swagger API documentation
- ✅ CRUD operations for destinations and accommodations
- ✅ Search and filtering capabilities
- ✅ Sample data structure for Vietnamese destinations

**Frontend (Flutter)**:
- ✅ Clean architecture with BLoC state management
- ✅ Vietnamese-themed UI design
- ✅ Routing setup with GoRouter
- ✅ API service layer with Dio
- ✅ Models for destinations and accommodations
- ✅ Responsive design structure

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. Backend Setup (Complete)
The backend is ready to use! Just need to:

```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

**Note**: Make sure you have MySQL running and create a database named `vietnam_tour_guide`.

### 2. Frontend Setup (Needs Flutter SDK)

Since you don't have Flutter installed yet, you'll need to:

1. **Install Flutter SDK**:
   - Download from: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
   - Extract and add to PATH
   - Run `flutter doctor` to verify installation

2. **Set up Flutter project**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   flutter create . --org com.vietnamtourguide
   # This will create the Flutter project structure
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
